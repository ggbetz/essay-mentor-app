# TESSY Essay Tutor

**The AI Co-Tutor that supports students in writing better essays, and teachers in grading them.**

> This is an experimental prototype ðŸ§ª and a proof of concept ðŸ”¥ developed by [Logikon AI](http://logikon.ai).
>
> In particular, the app is powered by a medium-sized language model,
which has been rudimentarily trained on a small fraction of Logikon's critical thinking dataset only.
Please do not use it for grading essays -- yet ðŸ˜‰.
